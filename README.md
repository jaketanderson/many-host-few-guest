# many-host-few-guest

This is a database of host-guests systems curated for host diversity. In the `guests` directory exist directories named for each guest, within which can be found `pdb` and `mol2` files for those guests. Likewise, the `hosts` directory contains directories named for each host. Not every combination of host and guest have associated experimental data; unpickle `directory.p` for a list of dictionaries, each describing a host-guest pair.
